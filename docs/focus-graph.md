# The focus graph: a worked example

_Moved out of [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) on 2026-09-21, copied line for line, nothing reworded, to keep the
guide under its size limit. The rules this example follows are in the guide, under **The Steam Deck focus
graph** and **Adding a new control**. This file is the long version: one control, wired end to end, with
every trap it hit on the device written down._

### The "From the notes" block (plan 58 phase 1)

A new stop under a reply that used a note or a shared troubleshooting tip
(`MainTabChatTranscript.tsx`, `buildKbNotesBlockElement`), one per turn ("live" or an archived
turn's own id). It sits after Show details / Read aloud in the walk, before whatever the utility
row used to reach:

```
Show details / Read aloud (unchanged)
   | Down                              ^ Up
"From the notes" block header   <- new stop, one per turn
   | Down                              ^ Up
whatever Down from the utility row already reached (the chip ladder, a permission hint,
the session context strip)
```

- **Up** hands the ring to Show details, falling back to the thumbs row when a turn has no Show
  details line — the same fallback `ContextChipLadder`'s own `onMoveUpFromLadder` already uses.
- **Down** with the block registered but nothing below it yet reuses exactly what
  `onMoveDownFromUtility` used to call directly; the block is spliced in front of that existing
  target, not a replacement for it.
- **Up from anything below the block also has to reach it** — first Deck rows (NOTES-BLOCK-01)
  found the block reachable walking Down from Show details but skipped walking Up from the
  session context strip, which landed straight back on Show details. Fixed by inserting
  `focusKbNotesBlock(turnKey)` (or, for the live turn, the shared `focusUpPastLiveKbNotesBlock()`)
  ahead of the existing fallback at every one of these call sites: the archived and live chip
  ladder's own `onMoveUpFromLadder`, and the troubleshooting and VAC-check permission-hint rows'
  `onMoveUp`. Each mirrors the Down path exactly — same target, opposite direction — rather than
  inventing a new route.
- **The session context strip's own `onMoveUp` needed the turn key right, not just the check.**
  A device rerun (0589565) found Up from that exact row — the collapsed "Session context (N
  turns) ▸ / Clear" line, the control that sits directly under the block on any normal, already
  completed reply — still skipping the block, because the first fix hardcoded the turn key
  `"live"`. A finished reply is not "live" any more by the time a person is sitting on this
  strip: the post-Ask slot reload moves `expandedTurnKey` onto the freshly archived turn's own
  id, and the block re-mounts under that id, not `"live"`. `focusUpPastSessionContextStripKbNotesBlock`
  reads whichever turn is actually expanded (`expandedTurnKey`) instead of assuming, so it finds
  the block wherever it is actually mounted — live, the newest archived turn, or (harmlessly) an
  older one expanded by hand.
- **Not fixed, and out of scope for this control specifically:** walking Up from the question box
  skips every reply row, the block included — a pre-existing gap wider than this one control,
  filed separately by the same Deck row rather than folded into this fix.
- **A** (`onOKButton`) or a tap (`onClick`) toggles the body open or closed. No `onActivate` —
  Steam fires it for A too, and wiring both would toggle twice on one press, the same trap the
  Show details line's own comment documents.
- **The row never remounts when toggled.** Only its label and an optional plain `<div>` body
  below it change, so there is nothing to hand the ring back to — unlike a spoiler fence's two
  different elements swapping (`MainTabBonsaiAiMarkdownChunk.tsx`), or the reasoning fold this
  mirrors (`buildReasoningFoldElement.tsx`).
- **Registered in a local module-level map** (`kbNotesBlockEls` in `MainTabChatTranscript.tsx`),
  not `replyStopRegistry.ts`'s `ReplyStopId` — that union is closed and this control's own lane
  could not extend it. A plain `.focus()` is still correct here (not `navFocusRegistry.ts`'s
  `takeNavFocus`): the row is a sibling of Show details and the other reply-row controls inside
  the same turn container, and `replyStopRegistry.ts`'s own `focusRegisteredReplyStop` already
  proves a bare `.focus()` carries Steam's ring correctly among exactly those siblings.
- **Never shows on a reply still hidden behind its own spoiler cover.** Gated on a real, live
  answer: `MainTabBonsaiAiMarkdownChunk.tsx` keeps a module-level tally of every currently-open
  `bonsai-spoiler` fence (`anySpoilerFenceOpen()`), and `MainTabChatTranscript.tsx` subscribes to
  it (`subscribeToSpoilerFenceOpenChange`) so it re-checks the moment a fence opens or closes. A
  plain module tally rather than a prop threaded down from `buildAnswerBubbleElement.tsx` (outside
  this control's own file list) or a `takeNavFocus`-style registry — safe as a single flag today
  because only one turn's answer is ever mounted at a time (`expandedTurnKey`), so "any fence open
  anywhere" and "any fence open on the one turn on screen" are the same fact. The block itself
  still renders in its own usual place after Show details, not literally nested inside the fence's
  own drawn box — true containment would need `buildAnswerBubbleElement.tsx` too.
- **Not yet backed by a device row.** `docs/testing.md` / `docs/testing-manual.md` still owe the
  D-pad walk this section's own rule asks for — recorded here, not skipped silently, because the
  bookkeeper owns those files, not this lane.
