# bonsAI Roadmap: knowledge base and RAG

> Moved out of [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) word for word on 2026-10-03 (plan 80, step 3). The long notes for these entries are in [roadmap-kb-details.md](roadmap-kb-details.md).

## Knowledge base and RAG

Everything about the game notes and the search that feeds them, in one place, so you can open this file and pick up
where you left off. **Read first:** [the status report](planning/37-rag-status-report.md) — the zoomed-out picture, what
each next step buys a person, and rough costs. It is kept in step with this section. Architecture:
[knowledge-base.md](knowledge-base.md). The agreed answer-quality work: [plan 30](planning/30-kb-answer-quality-plan.md).

Same rules as the lists above: five lines an entry, stars ascending in each list, a fix moves to **Deck check owed** and
then to [Done](#done-for-v050) in the same commit. The one difference is that the knowledge base keeps its bugs, its owed
checks and its plans together here instead of spread over three lists.

**Where things stand (2026-09-18).** **372 notes over 35 games, plus 159 Deck tips.** Wave two
added 27 notes and 32 tips. **Of the 72 questions a player might plainly ask about the twelve games added this
month, 64 now have a note** — the other eight were written on purpose to have none, so every question that was
meant to have an answer has one. Ten more games' notes landed 2026-09-18 — the five Mario Party games, Donkey
Kong 64, Yoshi's Story, Diddy Kong Racing, Super Smash Bros. 1999 and Grand Theft Auto III: The Definitive
Edition — written by two helpers in their own words from wiki pages read that same day, with the page, licence
and day recorded on every note. The library was built as version 2026.09.18 with every note and tip indexed and
its publish check passing. **Published 2026-09-23:** both Hugging Face and the GitHub release now serve
2026.09.18, read back after publishing to confirm it. **Blind test-question coverage finished 2026-09-26,**
107 more added. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#blind-questions-done). **Three new games landed 2026-09-26** (plan
70, helpers F and G): Brotato, Palworld and Skyrim, plus starting-out notes for Cyberpunk, Fallout 4 and Red
Dead 2. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#three-new-games-and-their-notes). **The next release, 2026.09.26, is
built: 38 games, 414 notes, 164 Deck tips.** It passes the release check and its Deck check, and the
Deck's copy matches it byte for byte. **Published by the maintainer 2026-09-27**
([plan 70](archive/70-kb-wave-four-and-deck-test-wave.md)), replacing 2026.09.18 (372 notes, 35 games, 159 tips).

**Finding the right note.** On the held-back questions nobody tuned against (177 rows), the search puts the
right note in the top three **85.3 times in a hundred**. Every one of the 21 notes written in wave two is found
in the top three for its own question, and 12 come first. Across all 72 questions about the new games, **58
find their note in the top three where 38 did**. Two rows out of 413 got worse against 24 better. On the 21
newly labelled questions for the games added this session, the right note came first 16 times and landed in
the top three 20 times. This was measured 2026-09-18 on the floored search against the new, bigger library —
a new series, started because rows were added, so it does not compare with any older count.

**The answer the Deck's own model writes**, over 61 questions with the corrected checks: it keeps the note's facts
**76.6 times in a hundred**, never contradicts its note **94.4**, attaches a note whenever one is due **100**,
shows the branch menu when due **98.6**, and comes out clean on all three runs **60.7**.

**Do not compare those against any older figure in this project.** Two faults were found and fixed in wave three:
the check could mark a right answer wrong for using different words than it expected, and it could miss a reply
that flatly said the opposite of its own note. The search test had also been reading a copy of the library from
31 August for weeks. Every answer and search number quoted before wave three carries one of those faults. The full
before and after is in [wave three's report](archive/48-kb-wave-three-session.md).

**Getting to the troubleshooting tips is where the wave fell short.** The tips themselves are much better — crash went
from 2 to 9, sound 1 to 8, picture 1 to 8, performance 2 to 10, controller 6 to 10, and the top crash tip no longer
tells someone to check a desktop that game mode does not have. But of 24 fresh sentences written by someone who had not
seen the rules, **6 reached the tips before and 8 after**. The rules are still phrase-shaped: they catch the exact
wording someone imagined and miss the neighbour.

**Pick up here, in order.**

**Wave three ran on 2026-09-07** ([48](archive/48-kb-wave-three-session.md)), after wave two's own Deck
evening ran the same evening, once the Deck was free.

1. ~~**Finish the device evening.**~~ **Done 2026-09-15.** The two checks that had never run — the honesty
   line, and tips still attaching when one fits — both pass on the device. The speed check passes three
   times with its fix. The *No tip for this* line never had a question that made it appear, and was
   retired by the maintainer on 2026-09-27 (`db4b3b4a`).
2. ~~**Fix the speed check.**~~ **Done.** It now refuses to pass a reading taken without a reply first, and
   read 547, 23 and 28 thousandths of a second against a one-second budget on 2026-09-15. Read that with
   the range in mind — the number swings with what is loaded in memory.
3. **Decide how to finish follow-ups.** The search half works on the device — it looks up the right thing
   you were just asking about — but the answer can still be about something else. The wrong-boss bug that
   once hit one run in three is fixed and proven on the Deck (`e1bf3324`, see Done). The options for
   finishing it still need writing up.
4. **The one-second wait on every question is now explained.** The Deck can only hold one model in
   memory at a time, so the model that writes the answer and the model that searches the notes keep
   pushing each other out. A search right after an answer measured 732 thousandths of a second; with
   the limit raised to two, tried safely on a spare copy of the setting that never touched the
   maintainer's own, it dropped to 24. Measured 2026-09-12. Evidence
   `docs/test-evidence/plan48-R6-deck-model-eviction.json`.
5. **Which of those two settings the maintainer's Deck is actually running: answered 2026-09-23.** The two
   starting paths were made to agree (`fae4a53`). Read on the Deck from three places at once — the running
   Ollama process, the auto-start file, and the Ollama tab's own switch — all three now say "keep two
   models loaded," and `ollama ps` showed both the answering model and the note-search model loaded at
   every one of four reads across three questions, with no load or unload logged in between. Still open:
   the drift from August to September. **Whether two models cause trouble with a game running: measured
   2026-09-26**, safety check stays unbuilt. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#cost-to-a-running-game-second-sighting).
   Evidence `docs/test-evidence/plan64-FOLLOWUP-MEMORY-EVICTION.json`.
6. **58 phase 1: finished.** [The plan](archive/58-phase-1-notes-shown-and-wiki-extracts.md)
   shows the note's own words under a reply and reads a wiki's own sentences into notes with no AI
   rewrite; it is done and archived. What is still owed on the Deck is in "The note's own words under the
   reply" below.
7. **Then wave four, now plan 70** — writing more notes. 58 phase 2 was replaced 2026-09-25 by
   [plan 70](archive/70-kb-wave-four-and-deck-test-wave.md), which re-read § 1 against the code and took
   its answers as D112.

**Wave two's own evening ran 2026-09-07** and wave three ran the same day; the results and the bug write-ups are
in [wave two's report](archive/47-kb-wave-two-session.md) § 8 and [wave three's](archive/48-kb-wave-three-session.md).
The five optional August rows were not run, and New Vegas still is not installed.

**A library point release went out 2026-09-07** carrying the corrected Black Mesa water note and nothing else — 293
notes, 156 tips, 25 games, unchanged. Installed on the Deck and checked: asked about the flooded rooms, the reply now
says the current is constant, says not to try to time it, and points at the wall switch that cuts the power. The old
advice to wait for a gap is gone. Evidence `docs/test-evidence/plan48-R5-blackmesa-corrected-note.json`.

### Calls waiting on you

None right now.

A new call lands here, one line, with what it decides. Every call already made is
written up in full in [the locked decisions file](audit/maintainer-decisions-locked.md); the knowledge-base
ones from this month are D81 to D88.

### Bugs

- ★ `[KB]` **A game's own tip is found only by its own words** — **OPEN, found 2026-09-26 (plan 70, flow
  L7).** "The words look blurry" misses the Render Scale tip that "the text looks blurry" finds.
  [Detail](roadmap-details.md#flow-l7-findings).
- ★ `[KB]` **In Speed mode, the meaning check on troubleshooting tips never runs** — **ACCEPTED, 2026-09-28.** Skipped on
  purpose by the maintainer's decision D62 #2 (2026-09-05) to save about a second per Speed question. D62 sketched a fallback
  (run the meaning search only when the word hits are thin); it would need a threshold picked and measured. Kept as an entry.
  `knowledge_base_service.py` line ~1121. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#speed-mode-tip-gap).
- ★★ `[KB]` **Black Mesa's electrified-water question attaches two unrelated early-game notes instead of its
  own** — **OPEN, found 2026-09-19.** The right, specific answer comes back, but two generic early-game
  notes are named underneath it instead of the real one, which does exist and now attaches too, but still
  ranks behind them. **Measured 2026-09-26:** ranking general notes lower is not the fix — it stays off.
  [Detail](roadmap-details.md#black-mesas-electrified-water-question).
- ★★ `[KB]` **Four questions still get notes about the wrong subject** — **OPEN, three of the four now say
  so, found 2026-09-07.** Asking Black Mesa how to tame a horse, Portal 2 where to buy a house, and a
  nonexistent Hades boss all still attach a note; the floor added this wave cannot catch these without
  losing correct answers elsewhere. **Sighted again 2026-09-26 (plan 70, flow L1):** a Hades boss question
  still attaches the wrong area's note, twice. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#wrong-subject-notes).
- ★★ `[KB]` **A troubleshooting question that only describes the symptom reaches no tips** — **ACCEPTED, held
  back 2026-09-06, re-measured 2026-09-07 and still held (D52, D81).** With nothing running, all 24 fresh
  plainly-worded problem sentences now reach the search, but six measured examples still attach a tip about
  something else. **Cause:** the meaning search only runs when the plain word search finds nothing, which is
  almost never. The real fix is rewriting the tips, its own entry below. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#a-troubleshooting-question-that-only-describes-the-symptom-reaches-no-tips).
- ★★ `[KB]` **Unrelated questions still get game cards stapled on** — **ACCEPTED 2026-08-27.** With a game running, *"thank
  you very much"* still attaches a card. Raising the keyword floor costs real matches, and the model mostly ignores an
  irrelevant card. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#ordinary-phrases-attach-game-cards) · [Earlier wording](roadmap-details.md#unrelated-questions-still-get-game-cards-stapled-on-2026-09-02-wording).
- ★★★★ `[KB]` **What ships loses to its own meaning half on questions nobody tuned against** — **ACCEPTED, decided
  2026-09-06.** Leaning the search toward meaning finds the right note first more often, but it buries a brand-new
  note whose meaning index is not built yet. **Not lifted until every note is guaranteed to have its index before
  it can be searched.** Two smaller objections are unanswered if this is ever revisited. Weights stay even for
  now. (D68, D82) [Detail](roadmap-details.md#the-shipping-retrieval-arm-loses-to-the-vector-half-alone-on-rows-nobody-tuned-against).

### Deck check owed

- ★★ `[KB]` **Hidden spoiler box stays shut on games with no Steam ID and on name-first questions** — **VERIFY,
  landed 2026-09-15, four commits, unit-tested.** A game known only by name now opens its box, and naming the
  boss up front keeps the answer in plain text. **DRG-01b passed on the Deck 2026-09-23:** the boss tactics
  came back in plain text with no cover, as expected. **Still owed:** STRAT-SPOIL-NAME-01, blocked since its
  game cannot be launched. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#hidden-spoiler-box-stays-shut-on-games-with-no-steam-id-and-on-name-first-questions).
  **2026-09-30 (plan 77 block 3, row STRAT-SPOIL-NAME-01):** could not run: none of Doom 64, Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64 or Pikmin 2 is on Recent Games. Evidence `docs/test-evidence/plan77-STRAT-SPOIL-NAME-01.json`.
- ★★ `[KB]` **The note's own words under the reply** — **VERIFY, third run 2026-09-19.** Header, open-scroll
  and live timing all pass; the upward walk lands cleanly on the block's header and the ladder walk holds up
  — the only stop still missing is the chip ladder inside the open block. Why the tip and
  one question in ten arrived late is now explained and fixed; a repeat check on the Deck 2026-09-19 showed
  no gap at all. Rows **NOTES-BLOCK-01**–**07**, **TEN-GAMES-01**, in [testing-manual.md](testing-manual.md).
### Next

- ★ `[KB]` **Measure answers with the character voice on** — **OPEN, switch already built.** The answer test's voice
  switch landed 6 September. What's still owed is one run with it turned on. Wave three planned that run
  ([48](archive/48-kb-wave-three-session.md) § 7), but its report has no voice results, so it never ran.
- ★ `[KB]` **Retire the Developer tab's "Install seed knowledge base" button** — **OPEN, an idea from the maintainer
  2026-10-02.** It was a stand-in from before the library was published; its own text still says the public download
  "is not live yet". Check first that no test or Deck walk still uses it.
- ★★ `[KB]` **The eval cannot yet prove the meaning search rescues many questions** — **OPEN, one measurement owed.** The
  slice of questions the word search cannot answer at all was 3 rows when last counted, before 36 more blind rows landed.
  Re-count it on the next search run before calling this closed. No code needed — the search test already reports that
  slice; it only needs a run (plan 70). [Detail](roadmap-details.md#eval-fixture-cannot-see-a-recall-failure).
- ★★★ `[KB]` **Card style pass** — **OPEN, measure first, added 2026-09-05.** Rewrite the 139 prose cards as labelled short
  lines, the shape the 16 structured cards use. Facts kept is already 92%, so the ceiling is low; do it only if the answer
  test shows the labelled shape scores better. Two to three days of content plus a rebuild.
- ★★★ `[KB]` **Deeper answer checks** — **OPEN, added 2026-09-05.** The answer test checks facts, contradictions, fences and
  the menu, and cannot see whether a reply was helpful or whether the model admitted not knowing. Add a small set of
  questions no card can answer, scored for an honest "I don't know", and a read by a person of ten replies a month.
  **Sighting 2026-09-26:** an answer turned a plain tip ("raise Render Scale") into advice that contradicts itself.
  [Detail](roadmap-details.md#flow-l7-findings).
- ★★★ `[KB]` **KB visual maps** — **OPEN.** Two shapes you named 2026-08-29: a dungeon map, and a boss outline with weak
  points marked. Nothing draws anything in a reply today. A dungeon map has to be authored, which sits behind the source
  policy and a corpus rebuild. Research first. The maintainer raised dungeon maps again 2026-09-07 as a wave-four idea.
  [Detail](roadmap-details.md#kb-visual-maps).
- ★★★ `[KB]` **Spoiler coverage as a tiered setting** — **OPEN, tiers confirmed 2026-09-01.** Strict fences bosses, endings
  and chapters; default fences only named story beats and endings; open fences nothing you asked about. Naming a boss still
  unlocks it in every tier. Needs the settings plumbing, a prompt per tier measured on the answer test, a control with a
  focus entry, and Deck QA. About three days. (D50) [Detail](roadmap-details.md#spoiler-coverage-should-be-a-setting-with-tiers) · [Fencing](roadmap-details.md#user-adjustable-spoiler-fencing-absorbed-into-the-tiered-setting).
- ★★★ `[KB]` **A troubleshooting question mostly never reaches the tips** — **OPEN, widened 2026-09-07.**
  Measured 2026-09-07: nine of ten ordinary problem sentences ("my game keeps crashing", "my game won't
  launch") reach nothing at all, since the word "crash" alone is deliberately too weak to route a question.
  **Related work landed 2026-09-26:** the tip cut-off and a false-positive word match are now fixed, and the
  "no tip for this" line was retired by the maintainer 2026-09-27 (`db4b3b4a`). (D81, D85) [Detail](roadmap-details.md#a-troubleshooting-question-mostly-never-reaches-the-tips).
- ★★★★ `[KB]` **KB online / versus strategy content** — **OPEN, discovery locked 2026-08-09.** Multiplayer questions
  (roles, callouts, co-op) get cards; today they get nothing specific. New card kinds and a spoiler table update, Left 4
  Dead 2 first, then Counter-Strike 2, from archive dumps only. Two to three weeks. [Plan](planning/17-kb-online-versus-strategy-content.md)
  [Detail](roadmap-details.md#kb-online--versus-strategy-content-and-rag-phase-5).
- ★★★★ `[KB]` `[QA]` **Measure how well the AI reads a screenshot: which game, which area, which boss** — **OPEN, added
  2026-09-25.** Never measured: no test question attaches a picture, and the notes are searched by the typed words only.
  First a scored set of real Deck screenshots (game, area, boss), run on each picture model the Deck offers; then fixes
  where it fails — the picture's guess fed into the search, notes that say what a place or boss looks like, and a screen
  guide per game (health bar, weapon slots, boss bar). [Detail](roadmap-details.md#measure-how-well-the-ai-reads-a-screenshot).
- ★★★★ `[KB]` **RAG Phase 4: extended retrieval** — **PARTIAL.** Tracks 1 and 2 shipped 2026-08-19 to
  2026-09-05 (D67); track 3, a running game's own Deck tip, is done and passed on the Deck 2026-09-26 (see
  Done). The chip labels fit on 2026-09-26. The chip promise passed on the Deck 2026-10-01 (P78-TIP-CHIP, P78-CHIP-PACE). Full note: [roadmap-details.md](roadmap-details.md#rag-phase-4-extended-retrieval).
  [Detail](roadmap-details.md#rag-phase-4-extended-retrieval).
- ★★★★ `[KB]` **RAG Phase 5: depth on the thirteen titles** — **PARTIAL.** 133 → 161 cards since 2026-08-29. **Counted
  2026-09-25:** only four of the original titles still have no enemy or item cards — Baldur's Gate 3, GTA San Andreas,
  The Sims 4 and Portal 2 — not eleven of thirteen as this entry used to say. Next: 40–60 entity cards in tranches with
  a quality read from you after the first; then chip ranking by meaning. Card authors cannot write blind test questions,
  so content and eval rows go in separate sessions. [Plan](planning/28-phase5-corpus-depth.md).
- ★★★★ `[KB]` **RAG Phase 7: retrieval infrastructure** — **OPEN.** Mostly nothing at 161 cards. What still
  matters: a thumbs-down that stops a wrong card coming back (three days), add-on packs before any large
  catalog (five days or more), a screenshot feeding the search. **The thumbs-down drawn 2026-09-26** (plan
  70, helper T): [three options, drawn true size](https://claude.ai/artifact/K2MXtVYoEYV6cNxsAzUh43).
  **Design C chosen by the maintainer 2026-09-27 (D112):** "Not really" opens the reason chips, and a
  "which note?" row only when two or three notes were used. Not built; ready for a feature session. [knowledge-base.md](knowledge-base.md) § Phase 7. [Detail](roadmap-details.md#rag-phase-7-community-tip-contribution-rag-phase-8).
- ★★★★★ `[KB]` **Community tip contribution** — **OPEN, unblocked.** A reader turns a good reply into a proposed card with
  one press: **Suggest as a tip** writes a valid card to the Desktop plus a GitHub attach link. Three to five days.
- ★★★★★★ `[KB]` **RAG Phase 8: catalog corpus** — **OPEN, intent only.** The change that gets most people's
  games real notes instead of the model's memory: top 1000 Steam titles, top 100 on Deck, an emulated slice.
  Months of work — needs a wiki-ingestion pipeline, licensing, a size budget, packs and an index. **As of
  2026-09-18:** the source study is done, the first ten games are written from cleared wiki sources, the
  library is at 38 games (since 2026-09-26), and landing them reopened the no-new-games lock (D111). [Detail](roadmap-details.md#rag-phase-8-catalog-corpus).
